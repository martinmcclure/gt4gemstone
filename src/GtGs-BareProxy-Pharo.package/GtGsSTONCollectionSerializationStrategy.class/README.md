I implement a serialization strategy that  uses STON  and requires gt4gemstone to exist in the remote stone.

I use STON  to serialize the elements of the remote collection and to materialize them back in local image. The #remoteFormat: and #localFormat: can then be used to change the value that is serialized remotely or the value that is passed to the local caller.
